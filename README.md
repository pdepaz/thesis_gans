## Thesis aim 

The purpose of this thesis is to learn about Deep Learning by providing a in-depth analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 

Some different types of GANs will be trained and evaluated, starting with a very simple “vanilla” GAN and then, using a more complex Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).


## Abstract

TO-DO



## What is a GAN?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced by [Ian Goodfellow](http://www.iangoodfellow.com/) in 2014 and quickly became one of the most popular generative models. 

It comprises of two ANN that fight one against the other (that is the reason of its name) resulting in a generation of new artificial data that follows the probability distribution of real data.

The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661/).

This is the architecture of a GAN:
