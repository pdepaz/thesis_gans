## Thesis aim 

The purpose of this thesis is to learn about Deep Learning by providing a in-depth analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
Some different types of GANs will be trained and evaluated, starting with a very simple “vanilla” GAN and then, using a more complex Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).


## Abstract
